# Tensorflow-Keras

I believe that you have Python on your PC

You'll have to install Tensorflow from here: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/ (I use windows with Tensorflow toolkit 9.0 - GPU - CUDA - cuDNN v7.0)

Be sure that you have download and install CPU or GPU, CUDA & cuDNN

Open your terminal and install:

Numpy: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy
Keras: https://keras.io/#installation
Scikit-learn: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html
Matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html
